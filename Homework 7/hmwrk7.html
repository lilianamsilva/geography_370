<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth based on ratios</h1>
<h2>Liliana Silva</h2>
<h3>I took the census data of Massachusetts' total estimated population that have received high school or higher education between the ages of 18 to 24.</h3>

<p></p>
<h3>I used the information of people in each county that have only recieved up to a highschool degree and divided that by the total population of those who have recieved an education high school or beyond. It shows the ratio in each county.</h3>
<h3>The mode I used to categorize for this map was the equal interval with five classes. The equal interval mode for my map divides each section by 600 people. It tries to split the data in five equal amounts.</h3>
<h3>Pros: It splits the data into even intervals. SHows how concentrated some counties are from the rest. It shows an overall natural break. </h3>
<h3>Cons: You can not tell the difference between the smaller values. It sometimes has tendencies to create classes that are not demonstrated in the map.</h3>

<h3>I used the information of people in each county that have had some college expirence or an associates degree and divided that by the total population of those who have recieved an education high school or beyond. It shows the ratio in each county.</h3>
<h3>The mode I used to categorize for this map was the fixed interval with five classes. The fixed interval mode for my map divides each section by 1200 people. I choose to split the data in five equal amounts, but it originially wanted to split it between 100 people.</h3>
<h3>Pros: Shows which county is the most concentrated.</h3>
<h3>Cons: Not every classification may be shown. Many of the counties look the same.</h3>

<h3>I used the information of people in each county that have recieved up to a bachelor's degree or beyond and divided that by the total population of those who have recieved an education high school or beyond. It shows the ratio in each county.</h3>
<h3>The mode I used to categorize for this map was the natural break with five classes. The natural break mode for my map divides each section by equal counties.</h3>
<h3>Pros: See an even distribution of classifications. Tell the differences in area.</h3>
<h3>Cons: There can be outliers included in a smaller data. This may show inconsitent data with the counties</h3>
