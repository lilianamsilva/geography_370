    <p>I downloaded the Cultural Vector Layer off of Natural Earth. I then exported that layer into QGIS. 
        I had already installed Indicatrix mapper as a pluggin into QGIS. This helped me in finding the cap and line segments for each projecttion.
        Next, I would click onto the project properties to see which projection I wanted the certain layer to be in.
        If I did not find the certain Authority ID right away, I would use the filter option. This would then limit my options.
        I would then click on my preffered/required projection and apply it to the map. This lead the layer to contort to the specified coordinates
        Last, I made it an image with the layer function and exported it as a png to my maps folder. I continued to do this for each projection.</p>
    
    <a href=""></a><h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 Projection has a linear scale.</h3>
    <h3>Pros: Preserves the area, angles, and directions.</h3>
    <h3>Cons: The area is distorted around the poles to try and keep the original length of each land.</h3>
