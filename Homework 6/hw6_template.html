<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Liliana Silva</h2>
<h3>I took the census data of Massachusetts' total estimated population that have received high school or higher education between the ages of 18 to 24. This shows which counties have the highest education rate. I was interested in this topic because I was looking at the nations top schools, and wanted to see which counties had the greatest amount of people with an education in Massachusetts. The data portrays the amount of people in each county with education greater than highschool. The lowest number is 4,976 people which is given by a light pink color and the highest is 157.922 people in a dark purple color. It gives the different ranges in between to portray the differences between counties. </h3>
